## Project Description

**Beyond-The-Game2** is a holistic web-based platform designed to support athletes whose careers have been disrupted or permanently ended due to injury. It integrates mental health support, physical rehabilitation resources, and career transition guidance into a single ecosystem. The platform recognizes that recovery is not just physical — it is emotional, social, and professional.

---

## The Problem Statement

Athletes experiencing career-altering injuries face multiple crises simultaneously:

* Loss of identity built around sport
* High rates of depression, anxiety, and emotional trauma
* Sudden financial instability
* Social disconnection from teammates and community
* Chronic pain and physical uncertainty
* Lack of structured career transition pathways

Existing solutions treat these problems separately. There is no unified system addressing the full spectrum of challenges injured athletes face. 

---

## The Solution

Beyond The Game provides a **three-pillar integrated support system**:

1. 🧠 **Mental Support** – Therapy access, journaling, community, mood tracking
2. 💪 **Physical Support** – Personalized rehab programs and physiotherapy guidance
3. 🚀 **Career Opportunities** – AI-powered career suggestions and mentorship

By combining professional care, peer communities, and intelligent tools in one platform, Beyond The Game becomes a comprehensive recovery ecosystem rather than a single-purpose app.
